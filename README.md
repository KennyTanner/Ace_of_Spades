# Ace_of_Spades

A little dabble in JavaScript, HTML and CSS, performed primarily as a taster and to gain some insight into some of the widly used languages out there.

Built the simple game where the user is shown 4 cards which are then rearranged face down, and the user guesses where the ace of spades is.

- dynamic user interface
- animation effects
- responsive layout
- localStorage functionality
