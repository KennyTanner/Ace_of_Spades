# Ace_of_Spades

A little dabble in JavaScript, HTML and CSS, performed primarily as practice in some widely used languages that I do not utilise in my day to day.

Built a simple game. In which, the user is shown 4 cards. They are then rearranged face down and the user guesses where the ace of spades is!

- dynamic user interface
- animation effects
- responsive layout
- localStorage functionality
